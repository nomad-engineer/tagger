Fix:
Image captions not updating in the gallary when caption profile is set to active

Find simerlar images tool:
This is not perfominig so well, slow loading times with many images and the workflow is not so nice to use. Rework this by:
- change the tool so that is job is only to generate a list of simerlar images for each selected image or the current active image if no images are selected,
- store the generated list to each images project data store. this negates the need to re calculate unless requred by the user.
- add button to clear the simerlar images listed for the selected images or active image.

Gallary:
- add option to display the simerlar images
- to the right of each image listing add a column showing the number of simerlar images listed in that images data, previously generated from the simerlar images tool.

Discuss the best option to allow the user to look through the simerer images and quickly remove what they dont want
