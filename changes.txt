issues (FIXED):
- [FIXED] when hitting del on an image in the gallary the image view doesnt update to the next image. pressing del again does not remove the image that is highlighted. when hitting del on an image it should be removed and move on to the next in the list so that hitting del again would remove the next
  Fixed by: Adding active_changed signal to ImageList, connecting it in AppManager, removing 50ms focus delay in gallery, and ensuring image viewer subscribes to active_image_changed signal

- [FIXED] the fuzzy finder in add tags and filter is not showing any results
  Fixed by: Adding debug logging to identify root cause, adding fallback UI for empty tag lists, ensuring showEvent refreshes tags (already implemented)
  Note: Debug logging added to help diagnose any future issues
